# elasticnet-regression
I learned about ElasticNet regression, a versatile regression technique that integrates the strengths of both Lasso and Ridge regression methods. By combining L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization penalties, ElasticNet effectively addresses multicollinearity issues in datasets while also performing automatic feature selection. This hybrid approach allows for more flexible modeling compared to using Lasso or Ridge regression alone, as it balances between sparsity (from Lasso) and robustness to outliers and multicollinearity (from Ridge). ElasticNet is particularly beneficial in scenarios where datasets have high-dimensional features or correlated predictors, offering a comprehensive solution to optimize model performance and interpretability.
